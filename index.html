  <h2>Introduction to sexism in minority groups</h2>
  <p>Although we live in a progressive soceiety, the modern world still discriminates against women. Even as someone that is part of the community you tend to be oblivious of those that have gone through worse. In certain countries the government is the problem, those that are meant to be examples are the ones passing laws that oppress women. In Belarus women aren't allowed to drive trucks , In Iran women can't travel without their husbands permission and in Russia domestic violence isn't really seen as a crime. The sadder truth is that women of minority groups face even more hostile situations than we can imagine not only from the outside world but even from the people in their society.  </p>
